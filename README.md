Getting a Reference Genome and Fastq/FASTA files

Skip this step if you already have a Reference Genome and Fastq/FASTA paired-end reads from an experiment. Otherwise, continue if you are using data from online.
Input: Can start with an SRA format (if using online data), but convert to Fastq or fasta file types using fastq dump.
Ex: Fastq-dump --split-files --fasta {Accession #}

Find a Bowtie2 index online(widely available) as a reference genome or use bowtie2-builder(not recommended).
